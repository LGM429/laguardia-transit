				The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) presented a LaGuardia mass transit proposal to the Queens Community Board 1 in September. The PANYNJ has already authorized further planning and design of the project to the tune of <a href=https://www.panynj.gov/port-authority/en/press-room/press-release-archives/2022-press-releases1/port-authority-board-of-commissioners-approves--30-million-for-p.html target="_blank">$30 million.</a> The meeting aimed to inform and field questions from the Queens community.

				The <a href=https://www.panynj.gov/port-authority/en/press-room/press-release-archives/2022-press-releases1/expert-panel-recommends-that-the-port-authority-move-forward-wit.html target="_blank">proposal's</a> main features include improved service to the LaGuardia Link Q70 shuttle service and a new non-stop shuttle service from end of the N/W line at Ditmars Avenue in Astoria to the airport. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The project has an onus on getting Manhattan-LaGuardia commuters “out of cars and onto mass transit,” as Hersh Parek, Director of Government and Community Relations, said. “Nearly half of customers that fly out of LaGuardia are coming from Manhattan.” The PANYNJ scrapped earlier plans for an air train service—in the style of JFK airport—due to cost and construction limitations.

					<h4>Proposed Transit</h4>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> 
						<div class="graphic-text">
							The PANYNJ plan includes a new non-stop shuttle from N/W Ditmars Avenue stop and expanded LaGuardia Link Q70 bus service that runs along the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE). The Port Authority also plans to build some bus-only lanes, including parts of 31st Street and 19th Avenue and a one-mile stretch along the shoulder of the BQE. The bus fleet will be all-electric, per the plan.

					<h4>Community Concerns</h4>
					<img src="images/real-hand.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">
						<div class="graphic-text">
							The community board members' main concerns were around bus fare cost and reliability. Some worried that a higher fare could be a limit access to the shuttle bus. The reliability of the all-electric bus fleet concerned members as well. However, community members were in favor of expanded Q70 service, saying that the Q70 is well-liked and well-utilized.
						</div>
						<div class="graphic-text">
							Port Authority representatives said the shuttle bus fare had not yet been calculated. They assured that electric buses would be reliable and that there will be accessibility improvements to Ditmars Avenue station.

					<h4>Climate Effects</h4>
					<img src="images/climate-change.png">
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">
						<div class="graphic-text">
							The climate crisis already affects populations globally. The average air temperature has risen <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/global-temperatures" target="_blank">1.1 degrees Celsius</a> since 1880, with most of the warming happening since 1975. The last nine years have been the warmest on record. 
						</div>
						<div class="graphic-text">
							Locally, New York City has seen effects of the crisis. Scientists agree that storm intensity and amount of rainfall continue to increase from climate change. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/tropical-storm-ophelia-hurricane.html" target="_blank">Tropical Storm Ophelia,</a>which flooded NYC at the end of September, is one such example.

				In parts of Queens and the South Bronx, pollution is an issue of equal access to a healthy environment. Sections of Astoria are known as <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/proposal-upgrade-peaker-plant-astorias-asthma-alley-more-half-measure-says-state-senator" target="_blank">"Asthma Alley,”</a> due to the elevated pollution levels from automobiles and power generation nearby. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief126.pdf" target="_blank">Studies</a> have shown higher rates of asthma in low-income neighborhoods adjacent to major transportation areas. Efforts to get cars off the road by providing clean transit alternatives may be part of New York's response to pollution and the climate crisis.

				The estimated cost of the Port Authority transit project is $500 million and projects to serve five million riders annually.
